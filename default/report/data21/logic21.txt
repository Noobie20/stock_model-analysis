------Evaluate alerts--------
(Assuming Bullish Alert)
* check each alert for 21 days since trigger date
Logic:
For each stock:
    For each day:                                                             # 21 days iteration
        if today's high > T3 or T2 or T1
            result = Target Achieved (T1/T2/T3)
        else if stock's close < SL (for 2 consecutive days):
            result = SL Hit

    if result != Target Achieved nor SL Hit even after 21 days:
        result = STAGNANT

(Assuming Bearish Alert)
* check each alert for 21 days since trigger date
Logic:
For each stock:
    For each day:                                                             # 21 days iteration
        if today's low < T3 or T2 or T1
            result = Target Achieved (T1/T2/T3)
        else if stock's close > SL (for 2 consecutive days):
            result = SL Hit

    if result != Target Achieved nor SL Hit even after 21 days:
        result = STAGNANT

----Evaluation of STAGNANT alerts-------
(Assuming Bullish Alert)

n = if stock's 21 day closing price < Trigger Price           (Small loss incurred)
p = if stock's 21 day closing price > Trigger Price           (Small profit achieved)

(n * 0.5) counted towards SL Hit
(p * 0.5) counted towards Target Achieved
i.e weightage of 0.5 to Stagnant alerts

(Assuming Bearish Alert)

n = if stock's 21 day closing price > Trigger Price           (Small loss incurred)
p = if stock's 21 day closing price < Trigger Price           (Small profit achieved)

(n * 0.5) counted towards SL Hit
(p * 0.5) counted towards Target Achieved
i.e weightage of 0.5 to Stagnant alerts

NOTE: Since the resolution of evaluating alerts is 1 day (i.e stock gets evaluated on OHLC of day instead of 15 min,30 min, 1 hr etc.), 
the precision of the percentage of target achieved and SL Hit is a bit low. The current evaluation method employed on google sheets
is more effective and precise as it relies on different logic compared to this and the resolution in that case is 15 min.
